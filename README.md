# W10-FaceMessenger

## Description

W10-FaceMessenger is a set of scripts bundled together to extract the most significant artifacts produced by the usage of the Windows Store application Messenger (Beta) by Facebook Inc.

As of now, W10-FaceMessenger is capable of extracting the following content:
- Contacts
- Conversations (and any messages exchanged within)
- Cached images (from user profile searches, messages, etc.)

As the name implies, these scripts are designed to work with Windows 10.

Support for other platforms is not planned for the near future.

## Requirements

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is everything you need to run these scripts.

Any external dependencies are already included.
