## Overview

W10-FaceMessenger is a forensic analysis tool designed to extract the most significant artifacts produced by the usage of the Microsoft Store application [Messenger (Beta)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/messenger-beta/9nblggh2t5jk) by Facebook Inc.

This tool is currently capable of extracting the following content:

- Contacts
- Messages
- Cached images
- Deleted database records

## Installation

Clone this repository into your local machine and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

We will be providing binary packages soon.

## Requirements

For the time being, you must run Microsoft Windows and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

W10-FaceMessenger must point to a Windows user profile directory such as `C:\Users\ricardoapl`.

Running `python.exe .\w10-facemessenger\main.py --help` should yield the following help message:

```
usage: main.py [-h] --input INPUT [--output OUTPUT] [--format {html,csv}] [--delimiter DELIMITER] [--depth {fast,complete}]

  --delimiter DELIMITER
                        specify csv report delimiter (defaults to ",")
  --depth {fast,complete}
                        fast: no images, no internet required; complete: with images, internet required, slower

```

## Support

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ricardoapl/w10-facemessenger/issues) to ask for help, request a new feature or report any bugs.

## Roadmap

Future work includes decoupling the ingest and report parts into separate tools, similar to what happens with other UNIX-like software.

Other planned changes:

- [ ] Adopt a consistent code style
- [ ] Create tests for core ingest functionality
- [ ] Sync with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [ ] Migrate to OOP
- [ ] Add JSON and SQLite output formats
- [ ] Remove CSV and HTML output formats
- [ ] Parse RoamingState
- [ ] Parse WAL files
- [ ] Add support for non-beta version of Messenger
- [ ] Add support for GNU/Linux and macOS
